##### User Registration

The platform presents an efficient user registration through email-based verification. A single verification email is sent to users to confirm their identities, enhancing account security and safeguarding sensitive data. Furthermore, the platform offers secure authentication mechanisms such as passwords and passkey for strong user verification. These measures establish a multi-layered approach to user authentication, mitigating the potential for unauthorized access and preserving the security of sensitive user information.


##### Onboarding of Orgenization and Configuration

The platform facilitates the smooth integration and enrollment of organizations into the decentralized identity platform, enabling them to establish a reliable presence and engage in secure digital interactions. This expedites the process for organizations to join the platform.


##### Onboarding of users

The platform presents an efficient user onboarding procedure through email-based invitation. A single invitation email is sent to users to join the platform send by other users. Furthermore, the platform offers secure authentication mechanisms such as passwords and passkey for strong user verification. These measures establish a multi-layered approach to user authentication, mitigating the potential for unauthorized access and preserving the security of sensitive user information.

##### Eco-system Management

##### Issuance and Verification

The platform implements a secure and consistent procedure for creating and distributing VCs, upholding the credibility and confidentiality of the credentials. It empowers trusted entities (like universities, employers, or government agencies) to issue VCs to individuals.Furthermore, the platform furnishes a means for individuals or entities relying on the credentials to authenticate and confirm the legitimacy of VCs provided by individuals. These entities could be employers, educational institutions, or any entity requiring validation of someone's qualifications or attributes.
##### Mobile Wallet for Holder

The platform acknowledges the importance of secure and user-centric digital wallets, granting users authority over their personal data. To fulfill this need, we've integrated non-custodial edge wallets into mobile applications. These wallets empower individuals to securely oversee their digital identities, credentials, and cryptographic keys on their mobile devices. The mobile app wallet is designed to be compatible with major operating systems, including iOS and Android, ensuring widespread accessibility across diverse user groups.
