### Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are like digital certificates that follow standards, allowing you to securely share information online without revealing unnecessary details. These credentials are digital representations of identity info, cryptographically signed by issuers. They're used to confirm and validate various types of data in IDtech apps.When you receive a verifiable credential, it's stored in a secure digital wallet. This wallet is a software app with encryption, storing your credentials and keys needed for self-sovereign identity. It's easy to privately show these credentials to others when needed.
